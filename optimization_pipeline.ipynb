    "AutoML FTW!!!\n",

    "Some thoughts:\n",
    "    At this point, many argue that AutoML is inefficient. The computational cost is huge.\n",
    "    And we can cut back on that with intelligence on the part of Data Scientists.\n",
    "    However, the same argument could be made about Data Analysis. And yet the benefits of ML \n",
    "    in that field are well documented.\n",

    "    Who is working on AutoAutoML???\n",

    "        -Count Encoding\n",

    "        NOTE: Ideally we would iterate through trying each of these encodings on EACH categorical feature.\n",
    "                -That's a lot of iterations!\n",
    "                -We could reduce this by thinking about the nature of the features.\n",
    "                -But that would require effort...\n",

    "    2) Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "        -Test them all!!!\n",
    "        \n",
    "    3) Try different feature pairings\n",
    "        -Just brute force combine them all, see what happens\n",
    "        -Also, create numerical features\n",

    "To Do:\n",
    "    1) Give lots of metrics comparing the various techniques.\n",
    "    2) Create visualizations comparing the techniques.\n",
    "    3) Comment about \n",
    "    4) Store all the results, so you could add additional tuning as needed\n",
